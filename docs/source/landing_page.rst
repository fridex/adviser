Cooperation with Thoth
======================

Internship
##########

Each year we work with university students which are involved in the project
and can gain valuable technical experience with cutting edge technologies.
Besides technical knowledge and experience, this cooperation also brings the
feel of `open source culture we support
<https://www.redhat.com/en/about/our-culture>`__. If you want to get in, do not
hesitate to contact us. Some of our colleages participated in this process and
are very valuable engineers in our team. We work with Boston University, Brno
University of Technology and Masaryk University but we are open to work with
other universities as well.

Bachelor and Diploma Theses
###########################

If you are a university student seeking for a bachelor or diploma thesis, we
can offer a cooperation. An example of bachelor and diploma thesis we did with
a coop with Brno University of Technology and Brno Masaryk University:

* `Checking performance characteristics of AI/ML libraries <https://research.redhat.com/blog/engineering_project/checking-performance-characteristics-of-ai-ml-libraries/>`__
* `Distributed machine learning training on OpenShift <https://research.redhat.com/blog/engineering_project/distributed-machine-learning-training-on-openshift/>`__
* `Predicting software stack issues in popular AI/ML libraries <https://research.redhat.com/blog/engineering_project/predicting-software-stack-issues-in-popular-ai-ml-libraries/>`__

We are not limited to the university listing stated. Also, we are not limited
to the listing of available projects on `Red Hat research site
<https://research.redhat.com/>`__. If you want to sign up for a thesis with us,
